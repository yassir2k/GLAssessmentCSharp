This repository contains 3 separate solutions that are somehow intertwined in producing the end result (offering web service as a resource).
Below is the description of the respective folders:
1 - CalculatorUnitTest: This sub solution contains the implementation of the Unit Testing for the calculator's add and subtract functionalities.
2 - CalculatorRESTfulWebService: Contains the implementation of the Web Service offering access via RESTful API.
3 - ISimpleCalculatorClassLibrary: Contains implementation of the interface, and the class implementing the interface. The other 2 solutions above contained reference to this class.

Finally, the CalculatorTest.sln is the (start up) Visual Studio solution file that keeps information about the organization of projects in the solution file
